	<p>Many properties of real-world world phenomena can be modelled
	with a 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal
	distribution</a>. In clinical psychology, many different
	scales are commonly used to describe values of normally
	distributed variables. This is a tool to help convert between
	these scales, and to discover their relationships. You can
	also define your own scales.</p>

	<p>Each scale has one of three different <dfn>types</dfn>:
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Normal</dt>
	    <dd>A scale of the "Normal" type is defined with a mean
	      value (<dfn>M</dfn>) and a standard deviation
	      (<dfn>SD</dfn>).  It is a continuous variable, that in
	      theory can take on any value from the set of real
	      numbers.</dd>
	    <dt>Discrete</dt>
	    <dd>A scale of the "Discrete" type is also defined with a
	    mean value and a standard deviation. It however only
	    includes values from a finite set of integer values.</dd>
	    <dt>Percentile</dt>
	    <dd>A value on a scale of the "Percentile" type tells you
	    how many percent of the total distribution lies "to the
	    left of" &ndash; is smaller than or equal to &ndash; the
	    current value. It is also called the
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative
	    distribution function</a> of the normal distribution.</dd>
	  </dl>

	at the moment just play around!</p>
